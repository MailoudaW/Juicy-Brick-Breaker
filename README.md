## Implementation

I included a ball, confetty effect as well as a texture for the brick. I also edited the fonts as well as the theme colors. I also added a wobble movement and screen shaker as well as the bricks falling from the top. 
I also added some Brick, Paddle and a Wall sound that I made on Audacity. I also added a music that I made on MuseScore. I aslo added more effects on my bricks.
